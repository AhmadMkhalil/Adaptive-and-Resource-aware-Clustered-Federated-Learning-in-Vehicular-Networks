# Driving Towards Efficiency: Adaptive Resource-Aware Clustered Federated Learning in Vehicular Networks

The official GitHub repository for the paper **"Driving Towards Efficiency: Adaptive Resource-Aware Clustered Federated Learning in Vehicular Networks,"** published at the 2024 22nd Mediterranean Communication and Computer Networking Conference (MedComNet). 

This repository will serve as a comprehensive resource for the implementation of the methods and experiments detailed in the paper. You can access the paper [here](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/abstract/document/10578208).

We aim to provide the finalized source code here, allowing researchers and practitioners to explore, replicate, and build upon our work. 

Stay tuned for updates as we finalize the code and related materials!
